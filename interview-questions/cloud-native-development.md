5. How do you handle data consistency across microservices?
   **Answer:** Data consistency in microservices requires careful consideration of different patterns and trade-offs. Here's a comprehensive approach:

   A. Consistency Models:
   - Strong Consistency:
     - Ensures all nodes see the same data at the same time
     - Use cases: Financial transactions, inventory management
     - Implementation: Two-phase commit, distributed transactions
     - Trade-offs: Higher latency, reduced availability
   
   - Eventual Consistency:
     - Data will become consistent over time
     - Use cases: Social media feeds, content delivery
     - Implementation: Event sourcing, CQRS
     - Trade-offs: Temporary inconsistencies, better performance

   B. Implementation Patterns:
   1. Saga Pattern:
      - Long-running transactions broken into smaller steps
      - Each step has a compensating transaction
      - Example: Order processing
        - Step 1: Create order
        - Step 2: Reserve inventory
        - Step 3: Process payment
        - If payment fails: Release inventory, cancel order
      - Tools: Temporal, AWS Step Functions
      - Best practices:
        - Design for idempotency
        - Implement proper error handling
        - Use event sourcing for audit trail
        - Implement retry mechanisms

   2. Event Sourcing:
      - Store all changes as a sequence of events
      - Rebuild state by replaying events
      - Example: User profile updates
        - Event 1: UserCreated
        - Event 2: EmailUpdated
        - Event 3: AddressChanged
      - Benefits:
        - Complete audit trail
        - Temporal queries
        - Easy debugging
      - Challenges:
        - Event versioning
        - Event schema evolution
        - Performance considerations

   3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
      - Separate read and write models
      - Write model: Handles commands and updates
      - Read model: Optimized for queries
      - Example: E-commerce system
        - Write: Process orders, update inventory
        - Read: Product catalog, order history
      - Implementation:
        - Use different databases for read/write
        - Implement event handlers for sync
        - Use materialized views for complex queries

   4. Outbox Pattern:
      - Store events in the same transaction as data
      - Background process publishes events
      - Ensures at-least-once delivery
      - Example: Order service
        - Save order and order_created event in same transaction
        - Background job publishes to message queue
      - Benefits:
        - Guaranteed event delivery
        - No lost events
        - Simplified error handling

   C. Practical Implementation Strategies:
   1. Database per Service:
      - Each service owns its data
      - No direct database sharing
      - Benefits:
        - Data isolation
        - Independent scaling
        - Technology flexibility
      - Challenges:
        - Data duplication
        - Synchronization overhead
        - Complex queries across services

   2. API Composition:
      - Aggregate data from multiple services
      - Use API Gateway or BFF (Backend for Frontend)
      - Example: Order details page
        - Fetch order from Order Service
        - Fetch customer from Customer Service
        - Fetch products from Product Service
      - Considerations:
        - Latency management
        - Error handling
        - Caching strategies

   3. Eventual Consistency with Compensation:
      - Accept temporary inconsistencies
      - Implement compensation mechanisms
      - Example: Inventory management
        - Allow negative inventory temporarily
        - Implement reordering triggers
        - Use background jobs for reconciliation
      - Best practices:
        - Clear business rules for inconsistency
        - Monitoring and alerting
        - Automated reconciliation

   D. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Monitor consistency metrics
   - Set up alerts for inconsistencies
   - Use tools like:
     - Jaeger for tracing
     - Prometheus for metrics
     - ELK stack for logging
   - Key metrics to track:
     - Event processing latency
     - Consistency lag
     - Error rates
     - Compensation transaction success

   E. Testing Strategies:
   - Contract testing between services
   - Integration testing for data flows
   - Chaos testing for failure scenarios
   - Consistency verification tools
   - Example test scenarios:
     - Service failure during transaction
     - Network partition recovery
     - Event replay after downtime
     - Compensation transaction execution

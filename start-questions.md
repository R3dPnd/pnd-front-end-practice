* Situation
  * In our system at JPMC, we generate a number of documents that are required to process or subset of loans. These documents are generated from a system created by a downstream team on a different development schedule indepanednet of ours, meaning long wait times for updates to these docuements and large overhead with cross communication.
* Task
  * I was tasked with creating a document generation system to replace our reliance on this system and design it in such a way that all of our existing documents could be handled through the same system and versioned appropriatly.
* Action
  * I created a stand alone microservice which takes a json data object and maps it to a template that corresponds to the versioned key provided by the caller. I leveraged jaspersoft to create the template and map the data it.
* Result
  * Changes to documents reduced in turaround time from an average of 1 month to an average of 1 week after change approval. New document creating reduced from 2-4 months to 1 month on average.
